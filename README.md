This is a 2017 take on a classic project: [The LackRack](https://wiki.eth0.nl/index.php/LackRack)

For those unfamiliar, the legs on IKEA's [LACK](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270/#/20011408)
side tables are spaced almost perfectly for rackmount equipment. With a price tag of around US$9.99 each, many
enterprising hackers have turned to using LACK tables in place of traditional server racks, which can easily fetch
over US$100 and are often too unwieldy for home use. 

The so-called "LackRack" has existed in many forms over the years. Builds published online include everything
from bolting multiple LACK tables together and adding rails to [welding steel supports](http://davidwhiteit.com/2016/01/lack-rack-mobile-enterprise-edition-pt1/)
 and [adding side panels](http://imgur.com/a/H7KZI). LackRack 20XX is a personal take on the project, with a 
number of added features designed to enhance stability and flexibility. 

Note that LackRack 20XX was designed for lightweight equipment and use in a home office. Those using heavier 
devices should plan their build accordingly.

### Materials
------

+ 3x [IKEA LackRacks](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270/#/20011408)
+ 1x [Pair of 16U Rack Rails](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JJ18P3K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
+ 4x [Locking Caster Wheels](http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1296565)
+ 4x [1.5" x 1 3/8" Mending Braces](http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=53085336)
+ 4x [1-1/2" x 5/8" L-Braces](http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=29675846)
+ [Rack Rail Screws and Washers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JQYUAQU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
+ 20x 14x1" Wood Screws*

The links above are the materials I purchased, chosen out of convenience and budget. It is definitely possible to 
substitute cheaper alternatives in some places (ex. making your own rails), or forgo some features entirely.

\* Admittedly, I didn't note the screw sizes during the build. The non-rackmount mounting holes on the rails have
a 1/4" diameter and the screws I used were 1" long, which suggests a 14x1" wood screw. The legs have a width
of 2", so the wood screws should be under that length.
